This is an app for users who eat alone or who wants to try out new restaurants but struggle to find like-minded companions. Users can choose a restaurant, either by searching or from recommendations from other people. After picking a place you will see who else wants to go there, you can then match up with someone and set up a time to eat.

We use Ionic to build this hybrid app. Dependencies thereby are required for testing this app

After cloning the repos, type the following for Dependencies

npm install

Happy testing!!!
