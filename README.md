This is an app for users who eat alone or who wants to try out new restaurants but struggle to find like-minded companions. Users can choose a restaurant, either by searching or from recommendations from other people. After picking a place you will see who else wants to go there, you can then match up with someone and set up a time to eat.

We use Ionic to build this hybrid app. You should follow http://ionicframework.com/ instruction to install Ionic properly.

After cloning the repos, do the following in your Command Line Interface(CLI) for Dependencies
